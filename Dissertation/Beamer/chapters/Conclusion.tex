\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We address the problem of dynamic seat assignment with social distancing.
        
        \item Our approach, stochastic planning policy, provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing seat assignments while ensuring the safety of customers under dynamic situation.
        
        \item We can estimate the occupancy rate when applying SPP according to $\gamma$.
    \end{itemize}
