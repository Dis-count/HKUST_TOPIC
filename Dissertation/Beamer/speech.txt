Good morning, Distinguished professors.

It is a great pleasure and honor to have you attending my preliminary exam. Thank you for your participation.

The title is seat planning and assignment with social distancing.


The content is divided into the following 6 parts. In the introduction, since the outbreak of the pandemic, social distancing as a valid physical measure to restrict the spread of the virus has been used in many places. 
In the introduction, it is worth noting that social distancing has been widely implemented as an effective physical measure to mitigate the spread of the virus since the outbreak of the pandemic.

For instance, in the dining hall and office, the staff paste social distancing tape on the floor to remind people to keep social distancing. In the restaurant, plastic boards have been used to separate the adjacent groups. In the park, the square line is drawn to confine the scope of group activity. Social distancing has also been used in seating areas, such as in amusement parks, shopping malls, restaurants and theaters or music concert.


The policy regarding social distance usually requires a limit on the size of each group, with people in the same group sitting together and different groups maintaining distance.


Then, I need to clarify the two terms, seat planning and seat assignment used in the following part.

Here are two forms of seat planning available. In the fixed seat planning, the seats designated (used) for social distancing will be dismantled/disabled beforehand. In the flexible seat planning, seat partitions are arranged for the coming group. If the current planned seats do not match the size of the group, the seat planning can be modified accordingly.

The seat assignment refers to the process of assigning the seats to the coming group. For example, here is a group of 2, we assign 3 seats to it, then three seats will be occupied and will not be used in the future.

There are different situations for seat planning and seat assignment. We consider to obtain the seat planning with the deterministic demand and stochastic demand.

For the seat assignment, we focus on the dynamic demand situation under fixed seat planning and flexible seat planning. Under the flexible seat planning, the assignment can be made immediately or later.


Regarding the literature review, there have been many works about seat planning with social distancing, including allocation of seats on airplanes, classrooms, trains, theaters. However, they all focus on the static model and the specific scenario not the real-time seat assignment.

In terms of dynamic seat assignment, we model our problem as dynamic multiple knapsack problem, which is related to multiple knapsack problem and dynamic knapsack problem. Dynamic seat assignment without social distancing has applications in the context of airplanes and trains.

The most related literature to our work is this paper, we share the same feature: assign-to-seat, that is, after assigning someone in a seat, the seat will not be used in the future.


Now, I introduce the seat planning problem with social distancing. There are M types of groups, group type i contains i people. The seat layout contains N rows, row j has Lj seats. Set delta seats as the social distancing. We make the following conversion, i.e., for each i, let n_i equal i plus delta. The value, ni, indicates the number of seats occupied by group type i. For each row, let Lj equal the number of physical seats plus delta. In this way, we can incorporate the social distancing into the seat planning problem. We use the following picture to illustrate the conversion. On the left hand side, the blue squares represent the social distancing, here it is one seat. There are 10 physical seats. On the right hand side, the gray square is the added virtual seat. For the first group, And we use 3 seats to represent the group of 2 with one seat as the social distancing. Then we don't need to consider the social distancing seperately after the conversion.

To better understand this problem, I introduce the concept of pattern. Pattern represents the seat planning for one row, denoted by h, where hi is the number of group type i. And the number of people can be accommodated is the size of h, the summation of this term.

Still use the above example to explain, here L = 11.

Then we define some patterns. Suppose the length is L. h is feasible if the summation of the sizes of all groups is no larger than the length of the row. 

The size of largest pattern is, that is, we divide the seats into the largest group as many as possible, then put the rest seats as a group if the number of seats permits.

The sum of this expression.

P17. Specifically, we can convert a given pattern into a largest or full pattern while ensuring the original group type requirements are met.

Mathematically, we can solve the following programming, here the constraints indicate a smaller group can take the seats planned for the larger group.

We develop an efficient algorithm to generate the full or largest pattern. We aim to allocate the remaining unoccupied seats to maximize the number of people. The core idea is to change the smaller group to the largest group as much as possible with the unoccupied seats. The specific procedure is shown here.

P29 the expected value difference of acceptance and rejection

P40 For the managerial insight of the DSA policy, we examine the impact of implementing social distancing. We know that when the demand is small, we will accept all groups with social distancing constraints. As the demand increases, there will be a difference between the number of people accepted with social distancing and without social distancing. What interests us is when the difference starts to be larger than 0.

Let gamma be the expected number of people at each period. Here we show two figures about the gap point when gamma are 2.5 and 1.9.

The gap point represents the first period when we have the difference. 


The gap points of different probabilities with the same gamma has little difference, which can be seen by the estimation of gap point.


Here we have a figure including the gap points under DSA with 200 probabilities, the blue points represent the period and red points represent the corresponding occupancy rate.

And these points can be fitted very well.

I will not go into details here.

Here we can get the conclusion that 
1.  we address dynamic assignment 
2.  we develop the efficient policy .
3.  the occupancy rate can be estimated by gamma.

Our work makes the first attempt to implement dynamic seat assignments

xij stands for the number of group type i in row j.
yi represents the number of surplus supply for group type i.
yi represents the number of inadequate supply for group type i.

We assume that the surplus supply for group type i can be occupied by smaller group type


The objective function is to maximize the expected number of people that can be assigned across multiple demand scenarios.

we could reformulate ssp in a vector form as problem 2, here for each scenario, problem 3 has the same form, if we can solve it efficiently which is helpful to solve problem 2. Fortunately, it is easy to solve problem 3 by the dual problem. 

The solution to SSP can be obtained by solving the master problem iteratively. We develop other approach to obtain the seat planning composed of full or largest pattern.

Now we see how to do the dynamic seat assignment. It contains two parts, seat planning can be seen as the supply for each group type, when the supply is enough, we will accept the corresponding request, if there is no supply for small group, we should decide whether to use a larger group type supply to cover the smaller one. Let dij represent the expected difference between the acceptance and rejection of group type i on the supply of group type j.

For each j larger than i, we find the largest one, denoted as j star. It is a necessary condition based on the current planning, we also use the value of stochastic programming to make the final decision.

The optimal policy is to make the decision when we have complete knowledge of all future requests in advance.



That concludes my presentation."
And that wraps up my presentation."
And that brings me to the end of my presentation."
And that's all for my presentation."

I would be delighted to address any questions, comments, or suggestions you may have. Please feel free to share your thoughts, and I will do my best to provide thorough responses. I value your insights and look forward to our discussion.

Hello, my supervisors! My research topic is dynamic city assignment with social distancing

2
For the introduction. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, it has been widely recognized that social distancing is a crucial measure to contain the spread of the virus and It's being used in many places.


For example, in the dining hall and in the office the stuff paste as a social, distancing tape on the floor, to remind people to keep social distancing.

And in the restaurant the plastic boards are used to separate the adjacent tables, and in park the square line is drawn to restrict the scope of group activities.


And social distancing has also been used in seating areas such as in the amusement park, the shopping mall, the restaurant, and the theaters. And our research is mainly focused on the dynamic seat assignment with social distancing

15
In the Literature Review, there are many works about seat planning with social distancing, including the allocation of seeds on airplanes, classrooms and trains. However, these works only considered the static model, not a real-time seat assignment. That is a main difference.

In the literature review, several studies have been conducted on seat planning with social distancing, encompassing various settings such as airplanes, classrooms, and trains. However, it is important to note that these works primarily focused on static seat allocation models, lacking consideration for real-time seat assignments. This distinction forms a significant gap in the existing research.

For the dynamic Seat assignment, we model our problem as a dynamic multiple knapsack problem which is related to multiple knapsack problem and dynamic knapsack problem and dynamic seat assignment without social distancing has the applications in the context of airplanes and trains. 

And our research is the first attempt to research the dynamic seat assignment with social distancing.

25
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.150
Zikang LI: To

26
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.379
Zikang LI: to consider is a dynamic state assignment with social distancing.

27
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.169
Zikang LI: And for the problem definition.

28
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.779
Zikang LI: At first we can see there's a state planning problem with social distancing. I suppose there are M

29
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.160
Zikang LI: group types and each group type I contains, I. People

30
00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:01.679
Zikang LI: and the seat layout contains N. Rows from one to N. And H. And the number of seats in zo, J.

31
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.320
Zikang LI: Is Sj.

32
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.959
and here we start the social distancing at as delta seeds.

33
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:18.199
Zikang LI: To incorporate the social distancing in the C planning problem, we should change the original size. I

34
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.190
Zikang LI: to an eye.

35
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.710
Zikang LI: In this way

36
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:50.950
Zikang LI: the social distancing can be considered in the seat planning, and do the same procedure for the for the size of the row. And here, as the length of the row is changed, form as as J. To Lj. To illustrate this, we can see this picture. The blue screen represents a social distancing, just one seed, and here that is a group of 2.

37
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.020
Zikang LI: And when we consider it Tizer, we can. Converse this problem.


39
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:14.500
Zikang LI: like this, we just use group of 3 to represent the group of 2 with one social distance, with one seat as a social distancing. In this way the social distancing can be considered in state planning.

40
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.810
Zikang LI: And here are some basic concepts. And

41
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:31.569
Zikang LI: the basic one is a python pattern, refers to the Cpr name for each group type in Wang Zhou, and here Ti is a

42
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.100
Ti.

43
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.450
Zikang LI: It's a number of group type one.

44
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.239
Zikang LI: T one is a number of group type one. And here's a loss. Loss represents the number of

45
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.450
Zikang LI: occupied seed in one python, and we call a python with a minimum loss

46
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.320
Zikang LI: as the largest patent.

47
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:08.039
Zikang LI: and for the full pattern. If a python satisfies that as a number of unusual seed is 0, except as a social, distancing way we call that python

48
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.770
Zikang LI: is a full patent.

49
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.629
Zikang LI: So we just we use an example to explain this kind, these concepts?

50
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:28.880
Zikang LI: Here we set the social distancing as one C, and there are 4 different group types, their size? From 2,

51
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.610
Zikang LI: 3, 4, 5 respectively.

52
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.890
and Zip. and the length of the show is 21,

53
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:53.430
Zikang LI: and here these 3 pythons are largest. By the way, we only list 3. There are also many other largest patents in this case.

54
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.689
and we can see these 3 pythons have the same loss of 4 at 5,

55
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.740
Zikang LI: and we cannot find a python with a loss of less than 5. So

56
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.890
these 3 patents are the largest python.

57
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:30.049
Zikang LI: and here are some interesting things. That is a largest item may not be for python. Here 0 0 0 4 is the largest python, but it's now full patent, because we can see we have 4

58
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:43.279
Zikang LI: group type 4. So it occupies. It occupies 4 times 5 equals 20, not 21 seats. So there is one unused state.

59
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.680
Zikang LI: So this python is not full python.

60
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.899
Zikang LI: and and also full pattern, may not be the largest pattern.

61
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.020
Zikang LI: and here the python, 1, 1, 4. As usual.

62
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.750
Zikang LI: it has a loss of 6,

63
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.619
Zikang LI: one plus one plus 4, and it's not largest.

64
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:16.619
Zikang LI: because the loss is 6, but it's 4, because we can calculate one times 2 plus one times 3 plus 4 times

65
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.510
Zikang LI: 4, and there are

66
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:26.439
Zikang LI: 21. That means the and user seed is 0. So this pipe chain is full.

67
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:39.309
Zikang LI: and and next. We will. So we will define as a dynamic state assignment problem, and we just use a discrete time period.

68
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:53.090
Zikang LI: And suppose there is one and only one group arrival at each period T ranges from one to T plus one the probability of an arrival of group type I is PI.

69
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.199
Zikang LI: And we use aisle

70
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.120
Zikang LI: to represent the remaining capacity, and Lj isn't

71
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.200
Zikang LI: Lj. Is a class day for Zhou J

72
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:14.970
Zikang LI: here. UIJ. Represent at use. We use Uij to denote the decision. If we assign group type I to

73
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:22.520
Zikang LI: so J. Uij, because because one is otherwise, Uij equals 0.

74
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.250
And here we use a capital U.

75
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.670
Zikang LI: L. To denote the decision side.

76
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.610
Zikang LI: That is, the Ui. J. Should satisfy a 2 constraint, one a zip.

77
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:35.980
and if we

78
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:47.760
Zikang LI: we can only assign group type I to at most one show that that is the summation of this Ui J should be no larger than

79
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:55.689
Zikang LI: what should be no larger than one, and if we are assigned group type of I to Jo J.

80
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.110
Zikang LI: Georgia should have enough capacity to accept the slides. That is a capacity, constraint.

81
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.089
And here, EJ is a unitial vector with this element being one.

82
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.699
3 TL.

83
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.800
Zikang LI: Is a value function at period given remaining capacity. L,

84
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.630
Zikang LI: and we can write down the dynamic programming formulation like this.

85
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.070
Zikang LI: and we know that it's dynamic and Ddp is very difficult to solve.

86
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.050
Zikang LI: caused by the case of dimensionality. So we develop

87
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.879
Zikang LI: the master to solve that problem.

88
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:53.359
Zikang LI: It. It basically contains 2 parts. The first one is, we obtain the planning composed of 4 or largest pipelines.

89
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.820
Zikang LI: and then we use

90
00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:02.959
Zikang LI: stochastic planning policy to make the decision wiser to accept or reject as a govern request.

91
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.030
Zikang LI: And

92
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.430
Zikang LI: this this part is about

93
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:17.480
how to obtain the C priming by stochastic programming. At first we build the scenario-based stochastic programming

94
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.980
Zikang LI: alright.

95
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:32.420
Zikang LI: That programming is short for Ssp. And here the decision variable. XIJ. Is a number of group type I, Angel J.

96
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:41.429
Zikang LI: And YI. Omega plus, is a number of supply for group type. I under.

97
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.740
Zikang LI: It's never Omega and YI Omega minors is a number of

98
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:57.490
Zikang LI: number of inadequate supply for group type. I, under Snapu Omega and see

99
00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.620
objective function is to maximize the expected

100
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.860
Zikang LI: number of people that can be assigned

101
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.690
Zikang LI: under many scenario demands. And here the scenario is a

102
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.370
demand for each group type.

103
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.809
Zikang LI: So here we have the many, many scenarios.

104
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.139
Zikang LI: And to solve this problem, we

105
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.930
at first, we we formulate

106
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.440
Zikang LI: as they evolve problem

107
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.500
in a vector form as problem 2.

108
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.009
Zikang LI: And here we can see for each scenario

109
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.640
Zikang LI: the Omega X hat has the same form.

110
00:11:45.050 --> 00:12:02.700
Zikang LI: So if we can solve problem 3 very efficiently, which will be helpful to solve. Problem 2. Luckily. The subproblem problem 3 is easy to solve by considering the dual problem

111
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.039
Zikang LI: as a feasible region of problem 4 is bounding and the optimal solution to this problem

112
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.370
Zikang LI: and

113
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.970
can be obtained.

114
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.959
Zikang LI: According to the complementary selectner's property.

115
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:27.620
Zikang LI: And then we can apply the vendors decomposition to solve this problem like today, Omega, be the lower bound of problem

116
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.099
Zikang LI: problem. For the optimal solution to Ssb

117
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:40.940
Zikang LI: can be obtained by solving the following vendors, master problem. And we need to solve this master problem

118
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.909
Zikang LI: iteratively, we will get the optimal solution.

119
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.599
Zikang LI: And to

120
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.070
specifically, we

121
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:58.109
Zikang LI: at first we consider the master problem and solve aid. We provide a solution to the sub problem.

122
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:08.309
Zikang LI: We mentioned that subproblem is very easy to solve, and it will provide the constraint to the master problem. And we continue this procedure until we get it.

123
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.270
Optimal solution.

124
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:18.829
Zikang LI: And one thing to mention is that, and although if we apply, if we solve is a problem 5,

125
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.720
Zikang LI: we can gaze at

126
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.919
optimal integer

127
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.040
Zikang LI: solution. However, solve this problem. This integer programming in some cases is

128
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:43.900
Zikang LI: still time consuming. So in practice, we consider the Lp relaxation. Problem file. And then we develop other approach to get the integral still finding

129
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:51.139
Zikang LI: with time limited. We didn't or didn't. Right. That's that approach here.

130
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.420
Zikang LI: And then we see how to do this dynamic state assignment

131
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:06.000
Zikang LI: it contains 2 parts that is a stochastic planning policy

132
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:15.110
Zikang LI: we call it as PP, in short, and it contains 2 parts. The first one is a group type control.

133
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.630
Zikang LI: Since we got the seed planning the seed planning can be seen as a supply for

134
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.790
Zikang LI: each group type.

135
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:32.589
Zikang LI: If we have the supply for one group type and we can accept the corresponding group requires.

136
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.439
Zikang LI: However, if we jump

137
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:46.160
Zikang LI: the corresponding supply, we should decide wiser. We use where? Whether we use a supply of a larger group type to cover the smaller.

138
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.929
Zikang LI: the smaller one.

139
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.919
Zikang LI: And here, like DIJT. Represents a difference between

140
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.560
Zikang LI: acceptance and rejection

141
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.320
Zikang LI: of of group type I on the group type J,

142
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.970
Zikang LI: and for the HJ.

143
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:16.750
Zikang LI: We calculate DIJT. And find the largest one denoted as DIJ. Star, T. If this value is larger than one, we will accept Group I

144
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.350
Zikang LI: otherwise I would review the chat as a group. But notice that

145
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.579
Zikang LI: this control policy is made based on the current planning.

146
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:38.149
Zikang LI: So it's not accurate. We should also consider the value of stochastic programming to do the final decision.

147
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.900
Zikang LI: And the stochastic programming

148
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.700
is the same.

149
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:50.280
Zikang LI: What do we mention about? There's a scenario based stochastic programming, and we

150
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:58.929
Zikang LI: should compare the value of acceptance and a value of rejection of the the of the stochastic programmings.

151
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:06.469
Zikang LI: and if voa is no less than Vo R. We will accept the group type. I otherwise prove the rejoicing.

152
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.090
Zikang LI: So that's a whole.

153
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.699
Zikang LI: stochastic! Planning policy!

154
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:29.210
Zikang LI: For the numerical result we only will mainly consider 2 parts. The first one is running time of vendors, the conversation, and sof the IP. Directly we can see the

155
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.819
Zikang LI: the writing time have been. The accommodation

156
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.410
Zikang LI: is very small

157
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.679
Zikang LI: compared with the IP.

158
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.499
Zikang LI: Under different scenarios demands those groups and seeds.

159
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.110
Zikang LI: and

160
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:54.689
Zikang LI: we also consider the performance of different policies compared with the optimal policy. The optimal policy

161
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.140
Zikang LI: is that we make the decision.

162
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:08.869
Zikang LI: And there's a under the assumptions. Either we have the full knowledge of the all the future requires, and then we make the decision.

163
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:23.249
Zikang LI: And here this row is, this column is about Sp. PP. Compared to the optimal policy. And we also consider the classical

164
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.630
Zikang LI: classical policies, including bit bid, pricing

165
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.190
Zikang LI: and the booking limited policy in in the revenue management.

166
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.880
Zikang LI: And here DP. One represent.

167
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.869
Zikang LI: because that way.

168
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:51.219
Zikang LI: We write as a Dp in angels right? And here with DP. One representative relaxation of, and we relax the angels to one Joe.

169
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.080
Zikang LI: and then we do the

170
00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:06.050
Zikang LI: We. We make the decision based on this relaxation! And here at Fc. Fis is a first come first serve policy.

171
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.389
Zikang LI: and we can see Spp has better performance than other policy under different demand

172
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.799
Zikang LI: and a final way to include.

173
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:23.769
Zikang LI: To conclude our work, we will address the problem

174
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:30.730
Zikang LI: of dynamic city assignment with social distancing. That's a first attempt by our knowledge

175
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:45.140
Zikang LI: and our approach stochastic program. Planning policy provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing seat assignment while ensuring the safety of customers and their dynamic situation.

Okay, that's all. Thank you for your lessoning.
