\section{Deterministic Model}

Firstly, we consider the deterministic model under social distancing constraints. When we have precise information about the number of people, we can utilize this model to arrange seats accordingly. For instance, during a company meeting where different group members need to sit together, we can determine the venue size based on a fixed number of attendees or accept only a portion of the demand based on the venue's capacity. The objective is to maximize the number of people sitting. The solver can solve this problem quickly with the moderate problem size. However, we find that the results show that most rows will not leave any empty seats. Based on this, we introduce the concepts of the largest pattern and full pattern for each row, and we can always use the largest pattern or full pattern as the optimal solution to meet the demand.
