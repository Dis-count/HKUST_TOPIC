\section*{Abstract}
This study addresses the seat planning and seat assignment problem with social distancing. First, we consider seat planning with deterministic demand. Then, we develop a scenario-based stochastic programming for generating the seat planning. We explore the dynamic situation when groups arrive at a venue and must be seated together while respecting minimum physical distance requirements. We propose the dynamic seat assignment policy for accepting or denying arriving groups. Our approach performs better than the traditional bid-price and booking-limit policies. The results provide insights for policymakers and venue managers on seat utilization rates and offer a practical tool for implementing social distancing measures while optimizing seat assignments.


Keywords: Social Distancing, Scenario-based Stochastic Programming, Seat Assignment, Dynamic Arrival.

% We also explore a relaxed setting where seat assignments can be made after the booking period.

% achieving an occupancy rate of over 70\% when total demand exceeds the number of seats and there are at least 2 people in each group.
