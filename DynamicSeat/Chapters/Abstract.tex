\section*{Abstract}
Social distancing has been broadly recognized and practiced as a non-pharmaceutical way to contain the spread of infectious diseases. In this study, we consider the dynamic seat assignment problem with social distancing, where groups arrive dynamically.

During a pandemic, the government may issue minimum physical distance requirements between people, which must be respected in the seating assignment. This problem becomes further complicated by the existence of groups of guests who will be seated together. To address this challenge, we provide an seat assignment policy to place arriving groups with given rows of seats.

Firstly, we develop the scenario-based method to generate a seat planning with stochastic demands of groups. When one group arrives, we decide to accept or deny it according to some certain rules.


Our results provide valuable insights for policymakers and venue managers regarding seat utilization rates and offer a guideline for policies related to social distancing measures. Overall, our proposed approach provides a practical tool for venues to implement social distancing measures while optimizing seat assignments and ensuring the safety of groups.
