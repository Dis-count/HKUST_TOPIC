\section*{Abstract}
Social distancing, a non-pharmaceutical way to contain the spread of an infectious disease, has been broadly recognized and practiced. In this paper, we consider the dynamic seat assignment problem with social distancing when the groups arrive dynamicly.

In a pandemic, the government may issue a minimum physical distance between people, which must be respected in the seating assignment. The problem is further complicated by the existence of groups of guests who will be seated together. To achieve such a goal, we provide an optimal seat assignment with given rows of seats and demands of groups.

We also develop a scenario-based method to obtain a seat assignment with stochastic demands of groups. In business, the group arrives dynamically, we give the method both with and without stochastic information.

With these results, we provide a guideline for policies related to seat utilization rate.
