\subsection{Dynamic Situations}
Generally speaking, there are two ways to purchase tickets for concerts or movies: no seat selection when booking and seat selection when booking. We consider the following dynamic demand situations, seat assignment after booking period and seat assignment when booking.


The seat assignment will not be made immediately for reservations without seat selection. The decision-maker must only reject or accept each request during the making-reservation stage. After the reservation deadline, the seller will inform the seat layout information to the customers before admission. For example, singing concert venues have more seats and higher ticket demand. Organizers usually do not determine the seats when booking and then inform customers of the seat information after the overall seat layout is determined.

% only provide the seat sections that can be selected at the time of booking or simply do

% For example, some theaters only provide seat reservations for the audience.

For seat assignment when booking, the specific procedure will be changed under the requirement of social distancing. The seat assignment will be arranged before the groups book the tickets, the groups only need to choose the corresponding-size seats when booking tickets. For example, movie theaters or small concert have relatively few seats, the attendance rate is usually low enough to allow free selection of seats directly online. The early seat planning can satisfy the requirement of social distancing and also save costs without changing seat allocation. The seat assignment could remain for one day because the same film genre will attract the same feature of different group types. 

% (Online for extention)
% the movie halls can seal the empty seats to prevent people from taking seats.

% For reservation with row selection, 
% the concerts will allow people to choose the section and row when making the reservation.

% 优先购票  公开发售
% 由于位置必须相连，相连座位门票一般会比单张门票位置稍差，如果是单人购票，建议把相连座位的勾去掉，这样系统会按从近到远的顺序自动为你筛选出较近的门票。

%  为了公平 分阶段 

% We don't care about the arrival sequence; only the number of groups matters. Because as long as the approximation about the number of groups is accurate, we can handle any sequence.

To obtain the final seat planning firstly, we develop the scenario-based stochastic programming.
