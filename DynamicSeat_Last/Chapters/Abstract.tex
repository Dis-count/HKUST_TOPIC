\section*{Abstract}
This study tackles the challenge of seat planning and assignment while enforcing social distancing measures. Initially, we analyze seat planning under deterministic demand conditions. Subsequently, we introduce a scenario-based stochastic programming approach to formulate seat planning strategies. We investigate the dynamic situation where groups enter a venue and need to sit together while adhering to minimum physical distancing criteria. We propose a dynamic seat assignment policy for accommodating or rejecting incoming groups. Our method outperforms traditional bid-price and booking-limit strategies. The findings furnish valuable insights for policymakers and venue managers regarding seat occupancy rates and provide a practical framework for implementing social distancing protocols while optimizing seat allocations.


Keywords: Social Distancing, Scenario-based Stochastic Programming, Seat Assignment, Dynamic Arrival.

% We also explore a relaxed setting where seat assignments can be made after the booking period.

% achieving an occupancy rate of over 70\% when total demand exceeds the number of seats and there are at least 2 people in each group.
