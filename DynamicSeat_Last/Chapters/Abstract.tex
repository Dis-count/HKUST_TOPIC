\section*{Abstract}
This study tackles the challenge of seat planning and assignment with social distancing measures. Initially, we analyze seat planning with deterministic requests. Subsequently, we introduce a scenario-based stochastic programming approach to formulate seat planning with stochastic requests. We also investigate the dynamic situation where groups enter a venue and need to sit together while adhering to physical distancing criteria. The seat plan can serve as the basis for the assignment. Combined with relaxed dynamic programming, we propose a dynamic seat assignment policy for either accommodating or rejecting incoming groups. Our method outperforms traditional bid-price and booking-limit strategies. The findings furnish valuable insights for policymakers and venue managers regarding seat occupancy rates and provide a practical framework for implementing social distancing protocols while optimizing seat allocations.


Keywords: Social Distancing, Scenario-based Stochastic Programming, Seating Management, Dynamic Arrival.

% We also explore a relaxed setting where seat assignments can be made after the booking period.
