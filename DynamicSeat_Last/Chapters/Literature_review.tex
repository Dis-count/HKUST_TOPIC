%\subsection{Seating Management with Social Distancing}
Seating management is a practical problem that presents unique challenges in various applications, each with its own complexities, particularly when accommodating group-based seating requests. For instance, in passenger rail services, groups differ not only in size but also in their departure and arrival destinations, requiring them to be assigned consecutive seats \citep{clausen2010off, deplano2019offline}. In social gatherings such as weddings or dinner galas, individuals often prefer to sit together at the same table while maintaining distance from other groups they may dislike \citep{lewis2016creating}. In parliamentary seating assignments, members of the same party are typically grouped in clusters to facilitate intra-party communication as much as possible \citep{vangerven2022parliament}. In e-sports gaming centers, customers arrive to play games in groups and require seating arrangements that allow them to sit together \citep{kwag2022optimal}.

Incorporating social distancing into seating management has introduced an additional layer of complexity, sparking a new stream of research. Some works focus on the layout design and determine seating positions to maximize physical distance between individuals, such as students in classrooms \citep{bortolete2022support} or customers in restaurants and beach umbrella arrangements \citep{fischetti2023safe}. Other works assume the seating layout is fixed, and assign seats to individuals while adhering to social distancing guidelines. For example, \citet{bortolete2022support} also consider the fixed seat setting for students in the classroom, \citet{salari2020social} and \citet{pavlik2021airplane} consider the seat assignment in the airplanes. These studies consider the seating management with social distancing for the individual requests.


Our work relates to seating management with social distancing for group-based requests, which has found its applications in various areas, including single-destination public transits \citep{moore2021seat}, airplanes \citep{ghorbani2020model, salari2022social}, trains \citep{haque2022optimization, haque2023social}, and theaters \citep{blom2022filling}. Due to the diversity of these applications, there are different issues to be addressed. For example, \citet{salari2022social} consider the distance between different groups and develop a seating assignment strategy that outperforms the simplistic airline policy of blocking all middle seats. In \citet{haque2023social}, the design of seat allocation for groups with social distancing not only takes into account the transmission risk within the train, but also considers the transmission risk between different cities at the stops. Our work is closely related to \citet{blom2022filling}, who address the group-based seating problem in theaters. While they primarily focuses on scenarios with known groups, referred to as seat planning with deterministic requests in our work, we investigate a broader range of demand forms. Specifically, we also study group-based seat planning with stochastic requests. Furthermore, we explore dynamic seat assignment, assuming that groups arrive sequentially according to a stochastic process.


Technically speaking, when all requests are known, the seating planning with deterministic requests (SPDR) problem falls within the category of the multiple knapsack problem \citep{martello1990knapsack}. Most existing works focus on deriving bounds or competitive ratios for algorithms designed to solve the general multiple knapsack problem \citep{khuri1994zero, ferreira1996solving, pisinger1999exact, chekuri2005polynomial}. However, in our problem, the sizes of item weights, profits and knapsack capacities are all integers. Moreover, there are many identical groups of the same size, making the aggregation form particularly useful for determining the seat plan. Our work emphasizes the structure and properties of the solution to this specific problem, offering valuable insights for our investigation into situations involving dynamic demand.


The seat assignment with dynamic requests (SADR) problem falls under the category of the dynamic multiple knapsack problem. A related problem is the dynamic stochastic knapsack problem, which has been extensively studied in the literature; e.g., \citet{kleywegt1998dynamic, kleywegt2001dynamic}, \citet{papastavrou1996dynamic}. In the dynamic stochastic knapsack problem, requests arrive sequentially, and their resource requirements and rewards are unknown until they arrive. In the SADR problem, requests also arrive sequentially; however, the resource requirements and rewards are integers drawn from a predefined set of fixed values, revealed upon arrival. Additionally, the SADR problem involves multiple knapsacks, adding another layer of complexity.
Research on the dynamic or stochastic multiple knapsack problem is limited. \citet{perry2009approximate} employs multiple knapsacks to model multiple time periods for solving a multiperiod, single-resource capacity reservation problem. This essentially remains a dynamic knapsack problem but involves time-varying capacity. \citet{tonissen2017column} considers a two-stage stochastic multiple knapsack problem with a set of scenarios, wherein the capacity of the knapsacks may be subject to disturbances. This problem is similar to the SPSR problem in our work, where the number of items is stochastic.


Generally speaking, the SADR problem relates to the revenue management (RM) problem, which has been extensively studied in industries such as airlines, hotels, and car rentals, where perishable inventory must be allocated dynamically to maximize revenue \citep{van2005introduction}. Network revenue management (NRM) extends traditional RM by considering multiple resources (e.g., flight legs, hotel nights) and interdependent demand \citep{williamson1992airline}. The standard NRM problem is typically formulated as a dynamic programming (DP) model, where decisions involve accepting or rejecting requests based on their revenue contribution and remaining capacity \citep{talluri1998analysis}. However, a significant challenge arises because the number of states grows exponentially with the problem size, rendering direct solutions computationally infeasible. To address this, various control policies have been proposed, such as bid-price \citep{adelman2007dynamic, bertsimas2003revenue}, booking limits \citep{gallego1997multiproduct}, and dynamic programming decomposition \citep{talluri2006theory, liu2008choice}. 


These methods typically assume that demand arrives individually (e.g., one seat per booking). However, in our problem, customers often request multiple units simultaneously, requiring decisions that must be made on an all-or-none basis for each request. This requirement introduces significant complexity in managing group arrivals \citep{talluri2006theory}. A notable study addressing group-like arrivals in revenue management examines hotel multi-day stays \citep{bitran1995application, goldman2002models, aydin2018decomposition}. While these works focus on customer classification and room-type allocation, they do not prioritize real-time assignment.

% in high-speed train ticket sales \citep{zhu2023assign}, where each booking must be assigned to a specific seat for the entire multi-leg journey in real time. Both scenarios involve assignment challenges, but with key differences: hotels allow flexible room allocation, while train seating requires immediate assignment. Our SADR problem aligns more closely with the latter - requiring real-time group assignment - but differs in that requests specify only group size, without fixed start dates (for hotels) or boarding stops (for trains).
 

The most closely related work to our SADR problem is high-speed train ticket allocation \citep{zhu2023assign}, as both involve real-time seat assignment with group-like constraints. 

% Zhu consider the connected segments where the group shows

However, there are two critical differences. First, the train ticket allocation only processes individual seat requests, with 'groups' emerging abstractly through multi-leg journeys (e.g., passengers occupying the same seat across connected segments); whereas in our SADR context, groups are explicit booking entities comprising multiple seats reserved simultaneously (e.g., a family reserving four seats as a single transaction). The second key difference concerns resource reusability. In train systems, seats are reusable because they can be allocated to different passengers across multiple journey legs. In contrast, SADR's seats are non-reusable since once assigned, they remain occupied for the entire duration. 

% These distinctions necessitate novel optimization approaches for SADR, particularly in handling bulk assignments and irreversible resource allocation.

% First, in our context, a 'group' is explicitly defined by its size (e.g., a family booking four seats together), whereas in train ticket allocation, the 'group' is an abstract concept derived from multi-leg journeys (e.g., passengers occupying the same seat across connected segments). That is, the train ticket allocation processes individual seat requests, whereas SADR handles group requests (multiple seats in one booking).
