\section{Seat Planning Problem with Social Distancing}\label{problem_description}
This section integrates social distancing measures into the seat planning process. By introducing some concepts, we present the deterministic seat planning problem. For the seat planning that does not utilize all available seats, we propose to improve the seat planning.

\subsection{Concepts}
Consider a seat layout comprising $N$ rows, with each row $j$ containing $L_j^0$ seats, for $j \in \mathcal{N} \coloneqq \{1,2, \ldots, N\}$. The venue will hold an event with multiple seat requests, where each request includes a group of multiple people. There are $M$ distinct group types, where each group type $i$, $i \in \mathcal{M} \coloneqq \{1, 2, \ldots, M\}$ consists of $i$ individuals. The request of each group type is represented by a demand vector $\mathbf{d} = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_M)^{\intercal}$, where $d_i$ is the number of group types $i$.

To adhere to social distancing requirements, individuals from the same group must sit together in one specific row while maintaining a distance—measured by the number of empty seats—from individuals in different groups. Since each group occupies only one row, we assume that the physical distance between different rows is sufficient. If the social distancing requirement is more stringent, an empty row can be implemented, as practiced by the theater in Berlin \cite{Berlin_theater}.

Let $\delta$ denote the social distancing, which could entail leaving one or more empty seats. Specifically, each group must ensure the empty seat(s) with the adjacent group(s). To model the social distancing requirements into the seat planning process, we define the size of group type $i$ as $n_i = i + \delta$, where $i \in \mathcal{M}$. Correspondingly, the size of each row is defined as $L_j = L_j^{0} + \delta$. It is a clear one-to-one mapping between the original physical seat planning and the model of seat planning. By incorporating the additional seat(s) and designating certain seat(s) for social distancing, we can integrate social distancing measures into the seat planning problem.

% This definition will not affect the set of all possible seat plannings.
% For any feasible pattern $h$, the number of physical seats that can be taken is 
% $\sum_{i} h_i i + (\sum_{i} h_{i} -1) \delta \leq L_{j}^{0}$
% $\sum_{i} h_{i}(i + \delta) \leq L_{j}^{0} +\delta$
% $\sum_{i} h_{i} n_{i} \leq L_{j}$.

We introduce the term, pattern, to represent the seat planning arrangement for a single row. A specific pattern can be represented by a vector $\bm{h} = (h_1, \ldots, h_M)$, where $h_i$ is the number of group type $i$ in the row for $i = 1,\ldots, M$. A feasible pattern, $\bm{h}$, must satisfy the condition $\sum_{i=1}^{M} h_i n_i \leq L$ and belong to the set of non-negative integer values, denoted as $\bm{h} \in \mathbb{N}^{M}$. Then a seat planning with $N$ rows can be expressed by $\bm{H} = \{\bm{h}_1; \ldots; \bm{h}_N\}$.

% In this context, the supply of a seat planning for group type $i$ can be defined as $\bm{X}_i= \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_{ij}$. Then $\bm{X} = (\bm{X}_{1}, \ldots, \bm{X}_{M})^T$ is the aggregate solution. In other words, $\bm{X}$ captures the number of each group type that can be allocated to the seat layout by summing up the supplies across all rows.

Let $|\bm{h}|$ indicate the maximum number of individuals that can be assigned according to pattern $\bm{h}$, i.e., $|\bm{h}| = \sum_{i =1}^{M} i h_i$. The size of $\bm{h}$, $|\bm{h}|$, provides a measure of the maximum number of seats that can be taken due to the implementation of social distancing constraints. By examining $|\bm{h}|$ associated with different patterns, we can assess the effectiveness of various seat planning configurations for accommodating the desired number of individuals while adhering to social distancing requirements.

\begin{example}
Consider the given values: $\delta = 1$, $L^{0} = 10$, and $M = 4$. By adding one seat to each group and the original row, we can realize the conversion, as shown in the following figure.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{./Figures/illustration.pdf}
    \caption{Illustration of Groups with Social Distancing}
\end{figure}

In the model, $L = L^{0} + 1 =11$, $n_i = i + 1$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4$. Then, the row can be represented by $\bm{h} = (2,1,1,0)$. The maximum number of individuals that can be accommodated is $|\bm{h}| = 7$.
\end{example}

To formulate the deterministic model, let $x_{ij}$ represent the number of group type $i$ planned in row $j$. The seat planning problem with deterministic request is formulated below.

\begin{align}
\max \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{M}  \sum_{j= 1}^{N} (n_i- \delta) x_{ij} \notag \\
\text {s.t.} \quad & \sum_{j= 1}^{N} x_{ij} \leq d_{i}, \quad i \in \mathcal{M}, \label{deter_upper}\\ 
& \sum_{i=1}^{M} n_{i} x_{ij} \leq L_j, j \in \mathcal{N}, \label{capa_con} \\
& x_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}, \quad i \in \mathcal{M}, j \in \mathcal{N}. \notag 
\end{align}

The objective is to maximize the number of individuals accommodated. Constraint \eqref{deter_upper} ensures the number of accommodated groups does not exceed the number of requests. Constraint \eqref{capa_con} stipulates that the number of seats allocated in each row does not exceed the size of the row.

By examining the monotonic ratio between the original group sizes and the adjusted group sizes, we can establish the upper bound of the optimal value of Problem \eqref{deter_upper}. This is illustrated in Proposition \ref{sol_relax_deter} and will be utilized in the bid-price control discussed in Section \ref{policies}.

\begin{prop}\label{sol_relax_deter}
For the LP relaxation of problem \eqref{deter_upper}, there exists an index $\tilde{i}$ such that the optimal solutions satisfy the following conditions: $x_{ij}^{*} = 0$ for all $j$, $i = 1,\ldots, \tilde{i}-1$; $\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{*} = d_{i}$ for $i = \tilde{i}+1,\ldots, M$; $\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{*} = \frac{L - \sum_{i = \tilde{i}+1}^{M} {d_i n_i}}{n_{\tilde{i}}}$ for $i = \tilde{i}$.
\end{prop}

For $i = 1,\ldots, \tilde{i}-1$, the optimal solutions have $x_{ij}^{*} = 0$ for all rows, indicating that no group type $i$ lower than index $\tilde{i}$ are assigned to any rows. For $i = \tilde{i}+1,\ldots, M$, the optimal solution assigns $\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{*} = d_{i}$ group type $i$ to meet the demand for group type $i$. For $i = \tilde{i}$, the optimal solution assigns $\sum_{j} x_{ij}^{*} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}L_{j} - \sum_{i = \tilde{i}+1}^{M} {d_i n_i}}{n_{\tilde{i}}}$ group type $\tilde{i}$ to the rows. This quantity is determined by the available supply, which is calculated as the remaining seats after accommodating the demands for group types $\tilde{i}+1$ to $M$, divided by the size of group type $\tilde{i}$, denoted as $n_{\tilde{i}}$.

Hence, the corresponding supply associated with the optimal solutions can be summarized as follows: $X_{\tilde{i}} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}L_{j} - \sum_{i = \tilde{i}+1}^{M} {d_i n_i}}{n_{\tilde{i}}}$, $X_{i} = d_{i}$ for $i = \tilde{i} +1,\ldots, M$, and $X_{i} = 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, \tilde{i}-1$.

\subsection{Seat Planning Composed of Full or Largest Patterns}\label{seat_planning_full_largest}
The seat planning obtained from problem \eqref{deter_upper} may not utilize all available seats, as it depends on the given requests. To improve a given seat planning and utilize all seats, we aim to generate a new seat planning composed of full or largest patterns while ensuring that the original group type requirements are met.

\begin{definition}
Consider a pattern $\bm{h} = (h_1, \ldots, h_M)$ for a row of size $L$. We define $\bm{h}$ as a full pattern if $\sum_{i=1}^{M} n_i h_i = L$. Addtionally, we refer to $\bm{h}$ as a largest pattern if its size $|\bm{h}| \geq |\bm{h}^{\prime}|$, for any other feasible pattern $\bm{h}^{\prime}$.
\end{definition}

In other words, a full pattern is one in which the sum of the product of the number of occurrences $h_i$ and the size $n_i$ of each group in the pattern is equal to the size of the row $L$. This ensures that the pattern fully occupies the available row seats. A largest pattern is one that either has the maximum size or is equal in size to other patterns, ensuring that it can accommodate the maximum number of individuals within the given row size.


\begin{prop}\label{lem_pattern}
If the size of a feasible pattern $\bm{h}$ is $|\bm{h}| = qM + \max\{r-\delta, 0\}$, where $q = \lfloor \frac{L}{M + \delta} \rfloor$, and $r = L - (M + \delta) q$, then this pattern is a largest pattern.
\end{prop}

The size, $qM + \max\{r-\delta, 0\}$, corresponds directly to a largest pattern that includes $q$ group type $M$ and $r$ seats for one group type $(r-\delta)$ when $r>\delta$. However, the form of the largest pattern is not unique; there are other largest patterns that share the same size.

% According to the definition of the largest pattern, the size of any largest pattern is given by $qM + \max\{r-\delta, 0\}$.

When $r = 0$, the largest pattern $\bm{h}$ is unique and full, indicating that only one pattern can accommodate the maximum number of individuals. On the other hand, when $r > \delta$, the largest pattern $\bm{h}$ is full, as it utilizes the available space up to the social distancing requirement.

\begin{example}
Consider the given values: $\delta = 1$, $L = 21$, and $M = 4$. The size of the largest pattern can be calculated as $qM + \max\{r-\delta, 0\} = 4 \times 4 + 0 = 16$. The largest patterns are as follows: $(1, 0, 1, 3)$, $(0, 1, 2, 2)$, $(0, 0, 0, 4)$, $(0, 0, 4, 1)$, and $(0, 2, 0, 3)$. Among these, $(0, 0, 0, 4)$ is the form referenced in Proposition \ref{lem_pattern}.

The following figure shows that the largest pattern may not be full and the full pattern may not be largest.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/full.pdf}
    \caption{Largest and Full Patterns}
\end{figure}

The first row can be represented by $(0, 0, 0, 4)$. It is a largest pattern as its size is 16. However, it does not satisfy the requirement of fully utilizing all available seats since $4 \times 5 \neq 21$. The second row can be represented by $(1, 1, 4, 0)$, which is a full pattern as it utilizes all available seats. However, its size is 15, indicating that it is not a largest pattern.
\end{example}

To obtain a seat planning composed of the full or largest patterns, we make the following statements.
Let the original seat planning be $\bm{H}$ and the desired seat planning be $\bm{H}^{\prime}$. To satisfy requirements for the original group types, the total quantity of groups from type $i$ to type $M$ in $\bm{H}^{\prime}$ must be at least equal to the total quantity from group type $i$ to group type $M$ in $\bm{H}$. Mathematically, we aim to find a feasible seat planning $\bm{H}^{\prime}$ such that $\sum_{k=i}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} H_{jk} \leq \sum_{k=i}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} H^{'}_{jk}, \forall i \in \mathcal{M}$. We say $\bm{H} \subseteq \bm{H}^{'}$ if this condition is satisfied.

To utilize all seats in the seat planning, the objective is to maximize the number of individuals that can be accommodated. Thus, we have the following formulation:

\begin{equation}\label{improve_seat}
  \begin{aligned}
  \max \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} (n_i-\delta)  x_{ij} \\
  s.t. \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{k=i}^{M} x_{kj} \geq  \sum_{k=i}^{M} \sum_{j=1}^{N} H_{jk}, i \in \mathcal{M} \\
  & \sum_{i=1}^{M} n_{i} x_{ij} \leq L_{j}, j \in \mathcal{N} \\
  & x_{ij} \in \mathbb{N}, i \in \mathcal{M}, j \in \mathcal{N}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{prop}\label{prop_construction}
Given a feasible seat planning $\bm{H}$, the optimal solution to problem \eqref{improve_seat} corresponds to a seat planning $\bm{H}^{\prime}$ such that $\bm{H} \subseteq \bm{H}^{\prime}$ and $\bm{H}^{'}$ is composed of full or largest patterns.
\end{prop}


This approach guarantees efficient seat allocation by constructing full or largest patterns while still accommodating the original groups' requirements. Furthermore, the improved seat planning can be used for the seat assignment when the group arrives sequentially.
