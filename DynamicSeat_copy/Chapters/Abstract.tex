\section*{Abstract}

This study addresses the dynamic seat assignment problem with social distancing, which arises when groups arrive at a venue and need to be seated together while respecting minimum physical distance requirements. To tackle this challenge, we develop a scenario-based stochastic programming for generating seat planning and propose a seat assignment policy for accepting or denying arriving groups. We found that our approach performs better than the traditional bid-price policy and booking-limit policy, even well compared with the offline optimal solution. The results provide insights for policymakers and venue managers on seat utilization rates and offer a practical tool for implementing social distancing measures while optimizing seat assignments and ensuring group safety.

% We also explore a relaxed setting where seat assignments can be made after the booking period.

% achieving an occupancy rate of over 70\% when total demand exceeds the number of seats and there are at least 2 people in each group.
