1. DSA -- after all arrivals
(Without Assign-to-seat)

Method: seat planning with scenario demands / seat planning with mean demand

2. Consider current arrival in scenarios.

3. Break tie

4. Dual price meaning  z_i + \beta_j n_i > i -> d_i = 0

5. 4 -> group of 6

6. Bid price update every time.

7. Demand variance?[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7] [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]

8. Stochastic and mean demand without resolving.

9. When the number of seats is not large, even DP-based performs not well.
Because it is not easy to construct a full pattern.


As a postgraduate student, you may be asked to provide information and insights about your research activities and progress during the panel's visit to your university. Here are some tips that may help you prepare for this:

Be prepared: Make sure you know the details of your research project, including the research question, the methodology you're using, and the expected outcomes. You should also be familiar with any preliminary results you've obtained so far.

Be concise: When describing your research, try to be as clear and concise as possible. Focus on the most important points and use plain language that is easy for non-experts to understand.

Be confident: Remember that you are the expert on your research project. Be confident when you speak about your work and be prepared to answer any questions that the panel may have.

Be honest: If there are any challenges or limitations to your research, be honest about them. It's better to acknowledge any shortcomings and explain how you're addressing them than to try to hide them.

Be respectful: Remember that the panel members are there to evaluate the research activities at your university. Be respectful and courteous when interacting with them, even if you disagree with their opinions or feedback.

Be proactive: If you have any questions or concerns about the panel's evaluation process, don't hesitate to ask. This is an opportunity for you to learn more about how your research is being evaluated and to get feedback on your work.

Overall, the key is to be well-prepared, confident, and honest during the panel's visit. Good luck!
