% There are some rules: time Distancing:  The time gap of each used room. Space Distancing:  Enlarge the space distancing of each room as much as possible. 

% That is, if we have a room contains $q_k$ seat numbers, and distance ratio is r, then the number of customers who can be served $p_i$ is less than $q_k\cdot r$. This condition can be set as a constraint.

Virables:

Room numbers $k \in K = \{1,\ldots,|K|\}$. 

Room $k$ contains seat number $q_k$. 

Number of customers in session $i$ is $p_i$ for each $i \in N = \{1,\ldots,n\}$. $w_{ik}$ is the session i's start time in the room $k$. $s_i$ is the service time for session $i$.(Given, in our case, we set all the service times are 2 hours.)

Feasibility:

% Time window constraints:
% Time window $[a_{i},b_{i}]$ for each group, but it satisfies the time constraints during opening time $[E, L]$ for the room.

Capacity constraint:
The number of customers in a session $p_i$ cannot exceed the product of the largest room capacity and ratio r, that is $p_i \leq q_k\cdot r$.

Solution:

Define the time interval $t_{i}$ for session $i$. It can be variable or the constant. In our case, we set the time interval as the variable and it should be larger than half an hour.

Define a binary variable $x_{ijk}$ for each room. If the room k is used by $(i,j)$ and $i$ followed by $j$, then $x_{ijk} = 1$, else $x_{ijk} = 0$.

Define
$w_{ik}$ is the session i's start time in the room $k$.

$s_i$ is the service time for each session.(Given)

% Set it as a time window VRP problem and add the distance constraints.

Analysis:

Add two virtual nodes (0,n+1) for each room. One is the start node, its time window can be a time point E meaning the room is open; the other is the end node, its time window is also a time point L meaning the room is closed.

Expected result:
Show the specific scheduling for the sessions.

Give the corresponding service start time.

% First in First out.

Benchmark: Manual work.

Question: How to determine the objective function?

        %   How to determine the distance for the only one group in a room?

          How to compare the result with the benchmark?

How to change the quadratic terms to the linear terms(linearization)

Note that the
$y =x_1 x_2$  where $x_1 \in \{0,1\}, x_2 \in [l,u] \to$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y \leq x_2 \\
& y \geq x_2 - u(1-x_1)    \\
& l x_1 \leq y \leq u x_1
\end{aligned}$$

Let $(w_{jk}-w_{ik}-s_i) = y_{ijk}$ and $T_{ijk} = x_{ijk} y_{ijk}$

% 多加三个 i*j*k 数量的约束. Let $l = 0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T_{ijk} \leq y_{ijk} \\
& T_{ijk} \geq y_{ijk} - u(1-x_{ijk})    \\
& T_{ijk} \leq u x_{ijk}
\end{aligned}$$
