1. DSA -- after all arrivals
(Without Assign-to-seat)

Method: seat planning with scenario demands / seat planning with mean demand

2. Consider current arrival in scenarios.

3. Break tie

4. Dual price meaning  z_i + \beta_j n_i > i -> d_i = 0

5. 4 -> group of 6

6. Bid price update every time.

7. Demand variance?[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7] [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]

8. Stochastic and mean demand without resolving.

9. When the number of seats is not large, even DP-based performs not well.
Because it is not easy to construct a full pattern.
