Dear Prof. QI, Prof. LIU,

Greetings!

Please find the attached file. I revised my manuscript according to your feedback last time. I highlighted the important points from Page 13.

I noticed that Prof. Liu had joined my meeting, sorry for not telling you that we cancelled the meeting today. Maybe we can discuss the details next Tuesday.
Thanks!

Best regards,
Zikang
