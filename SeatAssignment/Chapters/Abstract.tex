\section*{Abstract}
Social distancing, a non-pharmaceutical way to contain the spread of an infectious disease, has been broadly recognized and practiced. In this paper, we consider the 
seat assignment problem with social distancing when encountering deterministic and stochastic demands.

In a pandemic, the government may issue a minimum physical distance between people, which must be respected in the seating assignment. The problem is further complicated by the existence of groups of guests who will be seated together. To achieve such a goal, we provide an optimal assignment based on the column generation algorithm with given rows of seats and demands of groups. We also develop a column-and-cut method to obtain an assignment with stochastic demands of groups under scenarios. With these results, we can provide a guideline for policies related to seat utilization rate.
