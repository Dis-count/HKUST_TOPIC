\section*{Abstract}
We examine the dynamic stochastic multiple knapsack problem with multi-type items. Its dynamic programming formulation is computationally prohibitive to solve directly. To address this, we first develop a canonical bid-price control policy, a threshold policy that accepts items above a certain type-value and rejects those below. However, since this policy provides a uniform bid-price across all knapsacks, it cannot distinguish among them and requires a feasibility check for each item. We then develop a pattern-based bid-price control, which assigns a bid-price to an entire item configuration rather than to an individual size. This policy offers a superior approximation of the dynamic program's value function. Finally, we propose a dynamic primal policy to capture information potentially absent from the dual formulation, then present its asymptotic loss analysis. The numerical results show that the performances of the pattern-based bid-price control and dynamic primal policy are better than the traditional bid-price control.
