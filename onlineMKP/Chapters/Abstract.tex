\section*{Abstract}
We consider the online multi-type multiple knapsack problem.


% (considering venue-specific characteristics including maximum group size, physical distance requirements, and layout configurations).


% We investigate the impact of social distancing from the perspective of revenue loss. The findings furnish valuable insights for policymakers and venue managers regarding seat occupancy rates. We provide an operational solution for the venue manager, provide a practical framework for implementing social distancing protocols while optimizing seat allocations. For the policy maker, we provide tools to analyse the impact of implementing the social distancing measures.

% We also explore a relaxed setting where seat assignments can be made after the booking period.


% This study tackles the challenge of seat planning and assignment with social distancing measures. Initially, we analyze seat planning with deterministic requests. Subsequently, we introduce a scenario-based stochastic programming approach to formulate seat planning with stochastic requests. We also investigate the dynamic situation where groups enter a venue and need to sit together while adhering to physical distancing criteria. The seat plan can serve as the basis for the assignment. Combined with relaxed dynamic programming, we propose a dynamic seat assignment policy for either accommodating or rejecting incoming groups. Our method outperforms traditional bid-price and booking-limit control policies. The findings furnish valuable insights for policymakers and venue managers regarding seat occupancy rates and provide a practical framework for implementing social distancing protocols while optimizing seat allocations.
