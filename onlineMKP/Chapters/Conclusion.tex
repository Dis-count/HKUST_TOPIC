\section{Conclusion}\label{sec_conclusion}
We study the dynamic stochastic multiple knapsack problem with multi-type items. The canonical bid-price control policy cannot distinguish knapsacks when assigning the arriving item, then we develop a bid-price control policy based on patterns. However, it is still cumbersome to check the feasibility when assigning items for this policy. A straightforward and easily implementable approach can be made by the proposed primal dynamic primal policy. The asymptotic loss for this policy is proved to be $O(1)$.

We conduct several numerical experiments to investigate various aspects of our approach. First, we compare different policies. Our proposed policy demonstrates superior and more consistent performance relative to these benchmarks.
