\section{Conclusion}\label{sec_conclusion}
We study the dynamic stochastic multi-type multiple knapsack problem. We consider the bid-price control policy. Then we introduce the dynamic primal policy.

We conduct several numerical experiments to investigate various aspects of our approach. First, we compare different policies. Our proposed policy demonstrates superior and more consistent performance relative to these benchmarks.
