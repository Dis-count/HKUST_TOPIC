\section{Conclusion}\label{sec_conclusion}
We study the online multi-type multiple knapsack problem. We consider the bid-price control policy. Last but not least, to address the seat assignment with dynamic requests, we introduce the dynamic primal policy by integrating the relaxed dynamic programming and the group-type control allocation.

We conduct several numerical experiments to investigate various aspects of our approach. First, we compare different policies. Our proposed policy demonstrates superior and more consistent performance relative to these benchmarks. 



% While different probability distributions represent varying group profiles, our policy demonstrates consistent performance across different scenarios.


% Overall, our study emphasizes the operational significance of social distancing in the seat allocation and offers a fresh perspective for sellers and governments to implement seat assignment mechanisms that effectively promote social distancing requirement.
